# Assignment3

For homework assignment 3, you will work with Fashion MNISTLinks to an external site., a more fancier data set.

You must create a custom data loader as described in the first week of neural network lectures [2 points]
You will NOT receive credit for this if you use the pytorch prebuilt loader for Fashion MNIST!
You must create a working and trained neural network using only pytorch [2 points]
You must store your weights and create an import script so that I can evaluate your model without training it [2 points]
Highest accuracy score gets some extra credit!

Submit your forked repository URL here! :) I'll be manually grading this assignment.
